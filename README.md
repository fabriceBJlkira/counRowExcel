1) To run this file, you need php and composer

2) How to run ?

    - You need to install the library usign this comand :
        composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
    - Create a new folder in the project, name the new folder as uploads, or else an error apears in the statement while counting the row, because we need to add the file in uploads folder before counting his row.

3) Once it done, open your project on terminal and use this comand to start the server :
    php -S 127.0.0.1:8000

4) Enjoy :)
